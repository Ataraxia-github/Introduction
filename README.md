# Introduction
A brief introduction about my GitHub.

******
  **Unfortunately, I found that the Github account I created in 2018 was lost. In fact, it can't be found back together with some projects I saved before. But it doesn't matter. I still have this spare account created in 2020 to use. From today on, I will update and share my study materials with my partners from time to time.**
  
  **As a student majoring in network information security, I am learning the knowledge of privacy computing, including cryptography, federated learning, and secure multi-party computing. I will organize and share some code projects I have done, some good papers I have read, and some high-quality books and materials I have seen here. I hope that in this process, I can learn and progress with you!**
  
  **If you are also interested in privacy protection and privacy calculation, welcome to communicate with me, it will be my great honor. Wish us all good luck.**


 我很不幸地发现我2018年创建的那个Github账号丢失了，事实上它连同我以前保存的一些项目都找不回来了。但是没有关系，我还有这个2020年创建的备用账号可以使用，从今天开始，我将在这里不定期地向各位伙伴更新分享我的学习资料。
 
 作为一位网络信息安全专业的学生，我正在接触学习包括密码学、联邦学习、安全多方计算在内的隐私计算知识。我会把自己做过的一些代码项目，读过的一些不错的论文，连同看到的一些质量高的书籍资料，在这里进行整理分享。希望在这个过程中，能和大家一起学习进步！
 
 如果你也对隐私保护、隐私计算感兴趣，欢迎与我交流，那将是我的极大荣幸。祝我们都好运。
