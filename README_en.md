## Introduction
A brief introduction about my GitHub.


**Unfortunately, I found that the Github account I created in 2018 was lost. In fact, it can't be found back together with some projects I saved before. But it doesn't matter. I still have this spare account created in 2020 to use. From today on, I will update and share my study materials with my partners from time to time.**
  
**As a student majoring in network information security, I am learning the knowledge of privacy computing, including cryptography, federated learning, and secure multi-party computing. I will organize and share some code projects I have done, some good papers I have read, and some high-quality books and materials I have seen here. I hope that in this process, I can learn and progress with you!**
  
**If you are also interested in privacy protection and privacy calculation, welcome to communicate with me, it will be my great honor. Wish us all good luck.**
